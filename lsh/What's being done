#Hello World! :)


This document traces what's being done in the project. It also has a the details of what was executed.

I am building a shell from scratch, using "lsh" as guide/reference. Let's see how things go.


Let’s look at a shell from the top down. A shell does three main things in its lifetime.

Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.
Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.
Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.
